 * Bot list updater for Botnix
 *
 * There are a ton of discord bot listing sites out there, they all seem to have similar-ish APIs which let
 * you update your guild count and user count via a http POST with an Authorisation header. To allow this to
 * be done on a more or less generic basis, this script accepts details of these sites from a mysql table
 * (infobot_discord_list sites) and submits totals to them from all shards. Each shard has individual
 * responsibility for updating its row in the infobot_discord_counts table into the mysql cluster.
 *
 * Don't crontab this script more often than every few minutes, as you don't weant to annoy these sites by
 * spamming their API endpoints with updates!
 *
