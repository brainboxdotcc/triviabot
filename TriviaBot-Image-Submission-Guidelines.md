# Image Submission Guidelines for TriviaBot

* "Glitched" or "broken" images that crash Discord are **prohibited**.
* Pay attention to **copyright**. if you are not sure about the ownership of an image you are submitting, source images that are creative commons licensed from Wikipedia or similar.
* All question/answer images must be hosted on [imgur](https://imgur.com), for example web addresses of images must look like this: https://i.imgur.com/hhj3fFl.jpeg. Any images not matching this pattern will be rejected.
* Images must be of a reasonable resolution (at least 800 pixels wide is recommended)
* Images may be portrait, landscape or square
* Supported image formats are: GIF, JPEG, PNG.
* Animated GIFs are allowed, remember that an animated GIF must load promptly to ensure people can answer the question within the time limit allowed, so don't upload any animed GIFs that are so big they take Discord an age to download them.
* The max length for animated GIFs is 5 seconds (the length of time before the first hint in quickfire mode).
* Animated GIFs, if submitted, should not contain imagery which can induce [photosensitive seizures](https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/photosensitive-epilepsy) or [motion sickness](https://balanceanddizziness.org/disorders/vestibular-disorders/motion-and-cyber-sickness/).
* As with questions they relate to, images must relate to [notable subjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability)
* Besides small watermarks, images **should not** contain any text, unless unavoidable. Remember images must be suitable for all languages the bot supports!
* Do not give away the answer too easily via a question image. For example, a question asking "what colour is this" with a solid blue image is unlikely to be accepted!
* Answer images are used to clarify an answer only. For example, if an answer is particularly obscure the image may help clarify. Generally answer images are for entertainment purposes.
* Images should **NOT** be NSFW, or otherwise inappropriate images or illegal such as racist, pornographic or offensive content. Submitting inappropriate images will get you banned from **ALL USE** of the bot and disqualified from winning nitro.
* **Memes**, although funny the first time we see them, will not be accepted as question or answer images unless the question directly relates to said meme and the meme is [notable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability).
* Images must be full-colour unless this is not possible (e.g. a question relating to a black and white sketch or photograph) or no colour image is available
* If you are unsure, pop along to our [official discord support server for TriviaBot](https://discord.gg/brainbox) and ask a moderator!
